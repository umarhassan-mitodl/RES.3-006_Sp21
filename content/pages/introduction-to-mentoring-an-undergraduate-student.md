## Training Description

The success of the MICRO internships relies heavily on the success of the mentor-mentee interactions in the program. MICRO program mentors consist of graduate students, post-docs, research scientists, and faculty who guide the program participants in their research. The experience of these research mentors varies greatly, especially when it comes to mentoring in a virtual environment. Therefore, we provide our mentors with a set of resources aimed to support them in four main competencies in research mentoring: (1) Defining a research project and aligning expectations, (2) Planning and managing remote research tasks, (3) Effective and inclusive communication in a remote setup, and (4) Fostering independence. The interactive and methodical approach presented in this training is designed to help mentors develop skills for engaging in a productive, culturally-responsive relationship with their mentees. Each section includes worksheets and additional material to guide the mentors in putting into practice the competencies learned.

## Desired Learning Outcomes

By the end of this training, mentors will be able to:

- Articulate expectations for the research project based on shared goals.
- Define the undergraduate research project in terms of manageable scope, the relevant milestones, and the means to measure progress.
- Structure remote undergraduate mentoring and implement tools for information and data sharing.
- Provide critical feedback in a constructive and inclusive way to the mentee to assist them in reaching their full research potential.
- Foster mentee independence through the development of a network of mentors that they can reach out to for guidance and help on relevant questions.
- Access relevant resources for support and guidance for mentoring issues.
