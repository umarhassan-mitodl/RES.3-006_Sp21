## Objectives

At the end of this section, the mentors will be able to:

- Emphasize the accomplishments resulting from this semester and compare them to the expectations set at the beginning of the semester.
- If the student is continuing, plan the research project for the following semester.
- Provide and receive constructive feedback on the work conducted and the mentor-mentee relationship

## Description

This unit will focus on organizing and leading the end-of-term discussion. The goal is to teach the mentors how to lead a discussion for both the mentor and mentee to collect feedback and reflect on their experiences. We will provide a reminder on providing critical feedback in a constructive way and propose sample topics that can be brought up at the end of the semester. We will also develop communication schemes based on I-statements and open question formulation to encourage open discussion between the mentor and the mentee.

## Supporting Material

The mentors will be provided with a list of sample topics that can be brought up at the end-of-term discussion, along with some additional material on how to conduct a constructive and open conversation.
