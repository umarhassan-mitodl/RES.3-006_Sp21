There are three communications-focused assignments that are due over the course of the Fall Semester of the MICRO Program. You can find descriptions of all three assignments below:

### Assignment 1: So what is Materials Science, Anyway?

*Due: Week 7*

For this assignment, you will create either a blog post or a video that addresses the question, “What is Materials Science?.” By this point, you have watched several videos that explain many fundamental concepts of materials science and engineering, and you have started working side by (virtual) side on a materials-based research project. For your first assignment, you will need to create a blog post or a short video that explains what materials science is. You can target your post/video to a general audience, if you’d like. Alternatively, you can choose to address your post to students in your major, explaining how materials science relates to your chosen field of study. With your permission, we’d love to share your post on the MICRO website so that others can learn from it!

### Assignment 2: Literature Review

*Due: Week 10*

The goal of the second assignment is for you to develop and communicate a deeper understanding of the relevant materials that you are studying in your research project. 

Step 1: You will begin by conducting a literature review of the relevant materials and technologies and develop a bibliography of the important literature in the field. Take a look at the {{% resource_link "17a2c2f2-36e0-4603-a0a1-7e4b12148051" "Materials Research Society’s archive of the MRS Bulletin" %}}. Written for the broader scientific community, the MRS Bulletin focuses on a specific topic currently of interest in the field of MS&E. Look through to see if you can find a relevant volume.  Read through the issue to try to gain a better overview of the important research, developments, and challenges that relate to your field of Materials Science and Engineering research.

Then, you will do one of the following:

1.  Write an academic literature review that describes the current state of research regarding your material(s) of interest.  Your literature review should reflect, in length and style, the introductory section of a scientific paper.
2. Write an article or blog post directed to a general audience that describes your material and explains why research into this material is important and exciting.

 Your literature review will also be helpful for completing Assignment 3, below.

### Assignment 3: Final Project

*Presentation Date: End of Week 13*

For your final project, you will develop a 10-15 minute presentation that you will share over Zoom with the MICRO students and staff.  (You are welcome to invite your research advisors, too!) Your presentation should include the following:

1. A brief introduction to the materials and technologies that you are studying
2. A description of the research you undertook
3. A summary of the results of your research
4. A discussion of the conclusions that can be drawn from your results and any future work that you would recommend
